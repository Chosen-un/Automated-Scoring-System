The student's answer touches upon the environmental benefits and potential financial gains for schools if their design feature is adopted across Wales. They mention being 'environmentally friendly' and reducing electricity costs, which aligns with the 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact' criterion, though it's not fully developed. The student also notes potential financial benefits, which could be seen as a 'Community Benefits' as it might help schools allocate resources better. However, the answer lacks depth in explaining how this feature would enhance 'Future Resilience'. The 'Overall Understanding' is present as the student connects their design feature to broader impacts.","### Strengths
* You correctly identified that your design feature could make schools more environmentally friendly and potentially save or generate money.
* You attempted to link your feature to broader benefits, such as reduced electricity costs and potential income from surplus energy.
### Areas for Improvement
* Elaborate on how your design feature directly contributes to Wales-wide environmental improvements and community benefits. For example, you could explain how reduced energy consumption or renewable energy generation impacts the environment on a larger scale.
* Consider how your feature might help schools or the community in the face of future challenges, such as resource shortages or environmental changes, to strengthen your answer on 'Future Resilience'.
