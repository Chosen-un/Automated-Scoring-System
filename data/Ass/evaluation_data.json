The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.",
