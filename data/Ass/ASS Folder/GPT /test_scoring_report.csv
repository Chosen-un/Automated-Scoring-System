  ""Definition Accuracy"": 0,
  ""Example Relevance"": 0,
  ""Components Explanation"": 0,
  ""Clarity and Structure"": 0.5
}

The student’s answer is very brief and does not meet the expectations for each rubric criterion. The definition of a system is overly vague and lacks the key elements (components, interactions, purpose). The example given (‘Like trees’) is not a specific natural system and does not include any inputs, processes, or outputs, so it scores zero for example relevance and components explanation. The answer is short but understandable, so a small credit (0.5) is given for clarity and structure. Overall, the response shows a starting point but needs significant elaboration.","### Strengths
- The student identified that a system involves parts working together.

### Areas for Improvement
- Provide a clear, complete definition of a system.
- Give a specific natural example (e.g., a forest ecosystem) and describe its inputs, processes, and outputs.
- Expand the explanation to show how the components interact.

### Advice
- Keep trying! Start by writing a sentence that explains what a system is, then add a detailed example. You’ll get better with practice."
