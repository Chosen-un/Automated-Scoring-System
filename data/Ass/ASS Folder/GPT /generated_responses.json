This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

The student also does not describe how the identified systems interact or influence one another, resulting in a score of 0 for Systems Connections. Finally, there is no discussion of the positive environmental impact of the design feature, so that criterion also scores 0. The total score is therefore 1 out of a possible 5."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

    "generated_feedback": "### Strengths\n- You identified the Biophere and Geosphere as the natural systems your design connects to.\n- You mentioned that your design helps the environment, showing an awareness of positive impact.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n- Explain why you chose a vegetable patch and a gazebo as design features. What benefits do they bring?\n- Describe how each feature specifically interacts with the Biophere and Geosphere. For example, how does the vegetable patch use soil (Geosphere) and support local wildlife (Biophere)?\n\n### Advice\nKeep up the good work identifying systems! Adding a bit more detail about your choices and their connections will make your explanation even stronger.",
    "generated_rationale": "{\n  \"Feature Selection & Explanation\": 0,\n  \"Systems Identification\": 1,\n  \"Systems Connections\": 0,\n  \"Positive Environmental Impact\": 1\n}\n\nThe student correctly identified two natural systems (Biophere and Geosphere), earning full credit for Systems Identification. However, the answer lacks a clear explanation of why the vegetable patch and gazebo were chosen as design features, so Feature Selection & Explanation receives 0. The student also does not describe how the features interact with the identified systems, resulting in a 0 for Systems Connections. The statement that the design \"helps the environment in an eco\u2011friendly way\" is a brief acknowledgment of positive impact, which meets the basic requirement for Positive Environmental Impact and earns 1 point. Overall, the response shows awareness of systems but needs more detail and explanation to fully meet the rubric."

There is no discussion of how the feature could help schools become more resilient in the future, so Future Resilience receives 0. The overall understanding is moderate: the student demonstrates basic awareness of environmental education but lacks depth and detail, so a score of 1 is appropriate.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

They also expressed a positive environmental goal by aiming to create a better place for pupils, which meets the Positive Environmental Impact criterion. While the explanation of the feature is brief, it is still a valid feature selection, so a full point is awarded for Feature Selection & Explanation. The student hints at a connection between insects and the school environment, but does not explicitly describe how this feature interacts with other natural systems (e.g., Hydrosphere, Atmosphere). Therefore, a partial credit is given for Systems Connections, rounded to one point to maintain a lenient and encouraging tone for a 12\u201115\u2011year\u2011old learner.

In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

This satisfies the Feature Selection & Explanation criterion. They explicitly mention the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere as the system involved, and also refer to biodiversity and biophilic design, indicating awareness of the Biosphere. Thus the Systems Identification criterion is met. For Systems Connections, the student explains how the monitor\u2019s operation (opening windows) directly links to the atmosphere by bringing in fresh air, and how the use of biodegradable plastic reduces waste, connecting to the biosphere. These two distinct connections justify the maximum score of 2. Finally, the student states that the design will have a positive impact on the planet by improving air quality, reducing carbon, and providing health benefits, meeting the Positive Environmental Impact criterion. Overall, the answer meets all rubric criteria at the maximum level, earning a total score of 5."

However, the response lacks a clear description of a specific design feature and does not explain how that feature works or why it was chosen. The student identifies the atmosphere as a system, earning a full point for Systems Identification. No explicit connections to other systems (e.g., biosphere, hydrosphere) are described, so Systems Connections receives zero. The mention of reducing pollution indicates a positive environmental impact, earning one point. Overall, the answer meets the minimum for two criteria but needs more detail and depth to fully satisfy the rubric."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

However, the answer does not mention any of Earth\u2019s natural systems (e.g., Biosphere, Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Geosphere), so the Systems Identification criterion is not met. Likewise, there is no explicit discussion of how the hedges connect to those systems, so Systems Connections scores 0.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

However, the response lacks a clear description of the chosen design feature and how it was selected, so Feature Selection & Explanation receives 0. The student does not explain how the geosphere connects to other systems (e.g., biosphere, atmosphere), so Systems Connections is 0. Finally, while the student mentions an eco\u2011friendly/sustainable school, they do not articulate a specific positive environmental impact, resulting in 0 for Positive Environmental Impact. Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic awareness of one natural system but needs more detail and linkage to meet the rubric criteria."

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

The response mentions the Atmosphere but fails to identify other relevant Earth systems (e.g., Biosphere, Hydrosphere, Geosphere). Connections between the proposed features and the natural systems are not articulated; the student simply lists actions without linking them to system processes. However, the student does highlight positive environmental impacts by referencing recycling, composting, and local food production, which earns the full point for that criterion. Overall, the answer lacks depth in feature explanation, system identification, and system connections, resulting in a low score for those categories."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

They correctly identify the hydrosphere, biosphere, and implicitly the atmosphere, earning full credit for Systems Identification. However, the explanation of how each feature works and why it was chosen is very brief, so Feature Selection & Explanation receives 0. The student mentions that filtered rain water is used for the hydrosphere and that plants help the air and biosphere, which shows a basic connection between the design and the systems, but the connections are not fully elaborated; thus Systems Connections receives 1 out of 2. Positive Environmental Impact is acknowledged indirectly through the use of filtered rain water and planting, which suggests reduced waste and improved air quality, so the student earns 1 point. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good start but would benefit from more detailed explanations and explicit discussion of environmental benefits."

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.
