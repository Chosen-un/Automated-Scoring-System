The example of a forest is directly relevant to the question, earning full credit for Example Relevance. The student identifies an input (water) and an output (trees growing) but does not explicitly describe the processes that occur between them; this partial explanation earns half of the maximum for Components Explanation, rounded to 1 for simplicity. The answer is concise and understandable, meeting the Clarity and Structure criterion, so it receives full credit there.

The example of the human body is a valid system, but the question specifically asked for a natural system; the human body is a biological system, which is somewhat relevant but not the most natural example, so Example Relevance receives half credit. The student correctly identified an input (food) and an output (energy), but did not describe the processes that transform the input into the output, so Components Explanation is worth 1 out of 2. The answer is concise and understandable, yet it lacks clear organization and depth, earning half credit for Clarity and Structure. Overall, the student shows a good start but needs to expand on the definition, choose a more natural example, explain the processes, and improve the structure."

They provided a brief explanation of the impact of each action, noting that saving water protects freshwater boundaries and that recycling reduces ocean pollution, which satisfies the Explanation of Impact criterion. The answer connects these actions to key Earth systems, mentioning the water cycle and biodiversity, thus meeting the Relevance to Systems criterion at its maximum.

Reducing energy cuts down on fossil fuels that cause climate change helping planetary boundaries. Less meat means less deforestation for farms protecting ecosystems like rainforests.

The answer references climate boundaries, air systems, biodiversity, and tipping points, showing clear relevance to Earth\u2019s systems, which earns the full 2 points for Relevance to Systems. While the explanation is clear, it is somewhat brief and could benefit from deeper detail about the mechanisms and broader impacts; however, given the student\u2019s age and the concise nature of the response, it still satisfies the Depth and Clarity criterion at 1 point.

This satisfies the Feature Description criterion. The answer shows an understanding of how different elements (water, sun, soil, plants) work together, meeting the Systems Integration requirement. The mention of biodiversity benefits addresses Boundary Benefits, and the brief reference to parts connecting with soil covers Interconnections. The response is organized into two paragraphs, so Structure and Organization is awarded full credit. The language is simple and understandable, earning full points for Clarity and Language. The student does not provide specific evidence or data to support claims, so Use of Evidence receives zero. While the answer touches on the role of students as changemakers, it only briefly mentions this, so Changemaker Angle is awarded full credit. Depth of Analysis is limited; the explanation is surface\u2011level and lacks detail, so the student receives half of the possible points for this criterion. Overall, the answer demonstrates solid foundational knowledge but would benefit from more evidence and deeper exploration of the system\u2019s dynamics."

They also mention how different parts of the system interact, so Systems Integration is fully met. The brief mention of \"Benefits land change boundary\" indicates an attempt at Boundary Benefits, so we award full credit, though the explanation could be clearer. Interconnections are noted with plants and animals, so that criterion is satisfied. The answer lacks a clear paragraph structure or logical flow, so Structure and Organization receives 0. The student cites evidence from the chapter on ecosystems, earning full credit for Use of Evidence. The mention of \"Changemakers design it\" shows a Changemaker Angle, so that is full credit. Depth of Analysis is minimal; the response lists facts without exploring implications or connections, so it receives 0. Finally, the language is somewhat fragmented and hard to follow, so Clarity and Language is 0. Overall, the student demonstrates good foundational knowledge but needs to develop organization, depth, and clearer language to strengthen the response."

Waste is bad and reusing is good. T-shirt is an example of linear when it ends up in landfill but if you compost it, it can be circular because it goes into the soil.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

If we shift to circular we can use biological cycles (e.g. composting waste like food) and technical cycles (e.g. repairing electronics instead of throwing them away). One other example might be T-shirts, which in linear economy means the cotton grown to make therm is thrown away. If we use a circular way it means the cotton is recycled. Benefits inclulde the environment (less pollution and nature can recover) and social, eg. new jobs. The chapter on doughnut economy shows how we can do this. This means we can prevent overshoot day and it is very important for both humans and the planet.",

If we shift to circular we can use biological cycles (e.g. composting waste like food) and technical cycles (e.g. repairing electronics instead of throwing them away). One other example might be T-shirts, which in linear economy means the cotton grown to make therm is thrown away. If we use a circular way it means the cotton is recycled. Benefits inclulde the environment (less pollution and nature can recover) and social, eg. new jobs. The chapter on doughnut economy shows how we can do this. This means we can prevent overshoot day and it is very important for both humans and the planet.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

Shifting to circular solves by mimicking nature's cycles\u2014biological for decomposable items (T-shirt cotton returns to soil) and technical for durables (electronics refurbished).
