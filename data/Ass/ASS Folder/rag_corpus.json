My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",
