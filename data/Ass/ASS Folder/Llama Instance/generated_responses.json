When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

However, the explanation of how the design feature connects to these systems is lacking. The student mentions having plants, trees, and a rainwater collector, but fails to elaborate on how these elements interact with the natural systems. The student also does not provide a clear explanation of how their design feature has a positive environmental impact. The teacher should consider providing additional guidance on how to effectively link design features to natural systems and the importance of elaborating on the connections between elements."

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1. Provide a score for each rubric criterion.\n        2. Calculate the total score.\n        3. Write a detailed, objective rationale for the teacher explaining the scores.\n        4. Write a simple, encouraging, and actionable feedback for the student, using the following structure:\n           ### Strengths\n           * [List what the student did well, e.g., correctly defined a key term or provided a relevant example.]\n           ### Areas for Improvement\n           * [List one or two specific points the student can work on, e.g., 'Elaborate on how X connects to Y.']\n           ### Advice\n           * [Provide a short, encouraging piece of advice, e.g., 'Keep up the great work!']\n\n        Question: Q1:  Explain how your chosen design feature connects to Earth's natural systems.\n        Student Answer: null\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

However, the explanation is brief and lacks detail. The student identifies the solar panels as a feature, but fails to explain how it connects to the natural systems. The mention of large windows, skylights, and an outside learning area is a good start, but it's not clear how these features interact with the natural systems. The student also fails to provide any explanation of how their design feature has a positive environmental impact. Overall, the student shows some understanding of the concept, but needs to provide more detail and explanation to receive a higher score."

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

They mention 'no waste' and 'alot of water for people to drink', but do not provide any clear connection to the feature or how it would benefit the community. The answer also lacks coherence and clarity, making it difficult to assess their understanding. The student's answer does not demonstrate any understanding of future resilience or overall understanding of the topic. The score for Wales-Wide Environmental Impact is awarded as the student mentions 'no waste', but the answer is not detailed or accurate. The other criteria are not met due to the lack of clear and relevant information."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

Overall, the student shows potential but needs to develop their critical thinking and explanation skills."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.
