For Definition Accuracy, the student's definition is partially accurate, as it mentions connection, but lacks clarity and precision. For Example Relevance, the student provides a relevant example from nature, but it's a bit simplistic. For Components Explanation, the student attempts to explain the components of the system, but it's not entirely clear. For Clarity and Structure, the student's answer is somewhat unclear and lacks a logical structure. Overall, the student demonstrates some understanding of the concept, but needs to work on providing more accurate and detailed explanations."

They only mention that knowledge of systems helps design a garden, but do not provide any explanation or analysis of how this works. They also fail to address the sustainability aspect of the feature. The answer is too brief and lacks any evidence or interconnections to other systems. The student does not demonstrate any understanding of systems thinking or its application to real-world problems. The answer does not meet any of the criteria, resulting in a score of 0 for each rubric criterion. The student needs to develop their understanding of systems thinking and practice applying it to real-world problems."

For example, your school is a system made up of students, teachers, buildings, and schedules. Each part of your school system depends on the other to work well. Nature is a system too\u2014trees, animals, water, and soil all depend on each other. Systems thinking helps us see the big picture, so we can understand how one small change in one part of a system might affect everything else.\n        --- End of Factual Context ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1. Provide a score for each rubric criterion.\n        2. Calculate the total score.\n        3. Write a detailed, objective rationale for the teacher explaining the scores.\n        4. Write a simple, encouraging, and actionable feedback for the student, using the following structure:\n           ### Strengths\n           * [List what the student did well, e.g., correctly defined a key term or provided a relevant example.]\n           ### Areas for Improvement\n           * [List one or two specific points the student can work on, e.g., 'Elaborate on how X connects to Y.']\n           ### Advice\n           * [Provide a short, encouraging piece of advice, e.g., 'Keep up the great work!']\n\n        Question: Q3: Describe how knowledge of systems can help design a sustainable school feature like a garden or energy system.\n        Student Answer: Systems knowledge for garden design. Inputs soil nutrients processes photosynthesis outputs veggies. Benefits land change boundary. Interconnections plants and animals. Evidence from chapter on ecosystems. Changemakers design it. (180 words structured.)\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

They correctly identify the inputs, processes, and outputs of a garden system, highlighting the benefits of land change and boundary benefits. The student also mentions interconnections between plants and animals, which is a key aspect of systems thinking. However, the depth of analysis is limited, and the student does not provide a clear explanation of how the garden system interacts with other parts of the school system. The use of evidence from the chapter on ecosystems is a positive aspect, but the student could have elaborated more on how this knowledge informs their design. The changemaker angle is also present, but it could be more explicitly connected to the design of the garden system. Overall, the student shows promise in applying systems thinking to real-world problems, but could benefit from further development of their analysis and explanation."

Nature is a system too\u2014trees, animals, water, and soil all depend on each other.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The student's structure and organization could be improved, as their response jumps between ideas without clear transitions. Additionally, they could provide more evidence to support their claims and elaborate on their ideas. The student's language is clear, but could be more precise.

They have correctly identified the issues of waste and resource depletion, and provided some examples of how circular solutions can mitigate these problems. The student has also mentioned the benefits of a circular economy, including environmental and social advantages. However, the depth of analysis could be improved by exploring the connections between the different aspects of the circular economy and providing more specific examples. The student's use of evidence is good, but could be strengthened by including more concrete data or research findings.

They have correctly identified the main issues with linear economies (waste accumulation, resource scarcity, and crossing boundaries) and explained how a circular economy can solve these problems through closed loops and cycles. The student has also provided relevant examples of biological and technical cycles, such as biodegradable T-shirts and recycled batteries. However, the student's answer lacks a clear and detailed discussion of the benefits of a circular economy, which is reflected in the lower scores for 'Benefits Discussion' and 'Use of Evidence'. Additionally, the student's answer could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the problems and solutions, which is reflected in the lower score for 'Depth of Analysis'. Overall, the student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but could benefit from more detail and analysis."
