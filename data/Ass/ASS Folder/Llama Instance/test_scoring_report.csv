If we move to circular we can close the loop and repair or reuse things. There are 2 cycles, biological, for example when plants decompose and technical whem we can repair things like toys or fridges. Benefits include less waste which is better for the planet.",8,"{

94,Q8: Discuss the problems with linear economies and how shifting to circular can solve them.,Linear economies include things like factories which can cause habitat loss. Circular economy is when nature can repair and we use less of earths resources. Example of a cycle includes a repaired t-shirt or a recycled bottle. This helps with climate change also and it can create more jobs and fairer economy. It is an important shift because GDP and linear is not good enough to help people and the planet.,8,"{

95,Q8: Discuss the problems with linear economies and how shifting to circular can solve them.,"Linear economies cause problems including massive waste leading to landfills and ocean plastic plus waste of resources which affects the planet's boundaries. If we shift to circular we can use biological cycles (e.g. composting waste like food) and technical cycles (e.g. repairing electronics instead of throwing them away). One other example might be T-shirts, which in linear economy means the cotton grown to make therm is thrown away. If we use a circular way it means the cotton is recycled. Benefits inclulde the environment (less pollution and nature can recover) and social, eg. new jobs. The chapter on doughnut economy shows how we can do this. This means we can prevent overshoot day and it is very important for both humans and the planet.",9,"{
