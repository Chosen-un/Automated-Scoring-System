344,Q1:  Explain how your chosen design feature connects to Earth's natural systems.,"Our main subject was creating a carbon monitor connected to the classroom windows, so when there isn't enough air, the windows open automatically. That allows more air in the classroom, and no wasted time getting up to close the window. Also, the window frame would be made from aluminium which is sustainable. We also had chairs made out of the uniform from the year 6 leavers to stop wasting clothes that could be used for something entirely different.

The student has chosen a design feature (carbon monitor connected to classroom windows) and explained its functionality. The feature involves using sustainable materials like aluminium for the window frame and repurposing old uniforms for chairs, showing some creativity. However, the explanation of how these features connect to Earth's natural systems is limited. The student identifies some sustainable practices but doesn't explicitly link them to specific natural systems like the atmosphere or biosphere. The score breakdown is as follows: 'Feature Selection & Explanation' scores 1 because the student describes the design feature and its benefits. 'Systems Identification' scores 0 because the student doesn't explicitly identify or explain the natural systems involved. 'Systems Connections' scores 1 because, although not explicitly stated, there's an implicit connection between reducing carbon (implied by 'carbon monitor') and potentially improving air quality. 'Positive Environmental Impact' scores 1 because the student mentions reducing waste and using sustainable materials.","### Strengths

The student's answer lacks a clear understanding of the potential environmental and community benefits of implementing the chosen feature across all schools in Wales. The response is vague and doesn't directly address the question. However, it does show a basic understanding that the feature (gardening area) could be used by people, indicating some relevance to the topic. The score breakdown reflects this: 0 for 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact' because there's no mention of how it would affect the environment on a larger scale; 0 for 'Community Benefits' as there's no clear connection made to how it benefits the community; 0 for 'Future Resilience' since there's no discussion on how this feature would help schools in the future; and 1 for 'Overall Understanding' because, although the answer is vague, it does hint at a potential use of the gardening area.","### Strengths

The student's answer is quite brief and lacks detailed explanation. For 'Feature Selection & Explanation', the student mentions using solar panels and having an indoor garden, but doesn't explain how these features were chosen or how they work. For 'Systems Identification', the student implicitly refers to the atmosphere (solar energy) and biosphere (indoor garden), but doesn't explicitly state these systems. The 'Systems Connections' score is awarded because, although not explicitly stated, there's an implicit connection between using solar energy and supporting plant growth in the indoor garden. For 'Positive Environmental Impact', the student doesn't directly state how their feature helps the environment, but one can infer that using solar panels and growing plants indoors could reduce carbon footprint and improve air quality.","### Strengths

The student's answer attempts to address the question by mentioning design features such as recyclable and renewable materials, plants, flower beds, and a pond. However, the explanation is very brief and lacks depth. For 'Feature Selection & Explanation', the student scores 0.5 because they mention some features but fail to explain them adequately. For 'Systems Identification', the student also scores 0.5 as they vaguely refer to natural elements (plants, flower beds, pond) that are part of natural systems but do not explicitly identify the systems. The score for 'Systems Connections' is 1 because, although the student does not explicitly connect the features to specific natural systems, the mention of natural elements implies a basic understanding of their interrelation. For 'Positive Environmental Impact', the student scores 0.5 as they imply a positive impact through the use of recyclable/renewable materials and inclusion of natural elements, but this is not clearly stated or elaborated upon.","### Strengths
