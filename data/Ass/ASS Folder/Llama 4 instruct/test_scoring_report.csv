  ""Definition Accuracy"": 0,
  ""Example Relevance"": 1,
  ""Components Explanation"": 0,
  ""Clarity and Structure"": 0
}

The student's definition of a system as 'stuff working together' lacks precision and does not fully capture the concept of a system as described in the factual context. The example of 'trees' is relevant as it is from nature, but it fails to elaborate on the inputs, processes, and outputs as required by the question. The answer lacks clarity and structure, making it difficult to understand the student's full intent. The score breakdown reflects these observations: Definition Accuracy (0) due to the vague definition, Example Relevance (1) for attempting to provide a natural example, Components Explanation (0) for not explaining inputs, processes, and outputs, and Clarity and Structure (0) for the overall lack of coherence.","### Strengths
* Attempted to define a system and provide a natural example.
### Areas for Improvement
* Provide a clearer definition of a system.
* Elaborate on the example by explaining the inputs, processes, and outputs.
### Advice
