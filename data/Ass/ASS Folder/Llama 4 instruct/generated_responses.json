This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

Although the explanation is brief and lacks detail, it shows an understanding that their design involves natural systems. The student identifies relevant systems (biosphere and geosphere) but doesn't fully explain their connection. The answer hints at a positive environmental impact by using rainwater collection, which is a good start. However, the response lacks the depth required for a higher score."

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

For 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact,' the student mentions that it would be 'more sustainable in the long run' and 'help the environment a lot,' which indicates some understanding of environmental benefits, hence a score of 1. However, the answer fails to elaborate on how this would happen or provide specific examples, which is why it doesn't score higher. For 'Community Benefits' and 'Future Resilience,' the answer does not provide any relevant information or examples, resulting in a score of 0 for both criteria. The 'Overall Understanding' also scores 0 because the response is too vague and doesn't demonstrate a clear grasp of the project's aims or the broader implications of the feature's implementation."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

However, the phrase 'better pe' could be interpreted as a vague reference to 'better people' or an improvement in some aspect, potentially relating to environmental or community benefits if we stretch to connect 'pe' to 'people' or 'environment'. The answer does not clearly demonstrate an understanding of the environmental impact, community benefits, or future resilience of adopting a particular feature across all schools in Wales. The lack of detail and coherence in the response results in low scores across the rubric criteria. The only criterion where some minimal interpretation could be made is 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact', hence a score of 1."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

    "generated_rationale": "{\n  \"Feature Selection & Explanation\": 0.5,\n  \"Systems Identification\": 0.5,\n  \"Systems Connections\": 1,\n  \"Positive Environmental Impact\": 0.5\n}\n\nThe student's answer attempts to connect their design feature to Earth's natural systems by mentioning a vegetable patch and its relation to the Biosphere and Geosphere. However, the explanation is very brief and lacks depth. The student identifies the relevant systems but fails to elaborate on how they are connected or how the feature positively impacts the environment beyond being 'Eco friendly'. The score breakdown reflects the student's partial identification of the systems and a basic understanding of the positive environmental impact, but the lack of detailed explanation and connection between systems results in a lower total score."

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork.

The answer does not directly address Community Benefits or Future Resilience, as it doesn't elaborate on how the chosen feature would benefit the community or help schools in the future, resulting in scores of 0 for these criteria. The Overall Understanding score is 1 because the student shows a basic understanding of the potential positive outcomes of implementing the chosen feature across Wales, but the explanation is vague and lacks concrete examples or detailed reasoning."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

However, the explanation lacks depth and specific examples to fully address the Wales-Wide Environmental Impact criterion, hence scoring 1. The answer fails to clearly articulate community benefits beyond the school itself, resulting in a score of 0 for Community Benefits. There's no clear connection made to future resilience, so it scores 0 for that criterion as well. The student demonstrates a basic understanding of how their feature could work, thus scoring 1 for Overall Understanding."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

Think about how your feature affects or interacts with different Earth systems, and don't hesitate to explore examples or explanations that can help clarify these connections.",
    "generated_rationale": "{\n  \"Feature Selection & Explanation\": 0,\n  \"Systems Identification\": 1,\n  \"Systems Connections\": 0,\n  \"Positive Environmental Impact\": 0\n}\n\nThe student's answer lacks a clear explanation of the chosen design feature and its connection to Earth's natural systems. The student mentions that their 'project feature connects with atmosphere,' which indicates some awareness of the Systems Identification criterion, hence the score of 1. However, the explanation is too vague to demonstrate a meaningful understanding of how the feature interacts with the atmosphere or any other natural system. The answer fails to elaborate on the feature itself, its connection to other systems, or its positive environmental impact, resulting in low scores across the other criteria."

When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The answer fails to address community benefits, future resilience, or demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic, resulting in scores of 0 for those criteria."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

It would help the local community as the school could also sell any spare vegetables they grow to the locals.

The mention of 'Energy Systems' does not directly relate to the question about the impact of implementing a chosen feature across all schools in Wales. However, the student does touch upon a relevant topic, potentially indicating some understanding of environmental or systemic impacts. The score breakdown reflects the limited information provided: 1 point for 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact' because the mention of 'Energy Systems' could imply a consideration of environmental or systemic factors, albeit very vaguely. The other criteria are scored 0 because there is no clear evidence in the answer to support them."

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

While they mention creating their own food in school, the explanation lacks depth and clarity. The student identifies some connection to natural systems by mentioning growing crops, which relates to the biosphere. However, the explanation of how these features connect to Earth's natural systems is limited and lacks clear connections between the systems. The astro turf football pitch seems unrelated to natural systems, which dilutes the focus on environmental impact.

The student explains that this feature will make kids feel positive and connected to nature. However, the explanation lacks a clear connection to Earth's natural systems. The score breakdown is as follows: Feature Selection & Explanation (1): The student describes their design feature, but the explanation is limited and lacks clarity. Systems Identification (0): The student fails to identify any specific natural systems. Systems Connections (1): The student attempts to connect their feature to the environment, but the connection is vague and not well-elaborated. Positive Environmental Impact (1): The student suggests that the hedges will have a positive impact by making children feel connected to nature. To improve, the student should elaborate on how their design feature interacts with specific natural systems."

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The answer 'my design has materials that can be recycled' is very brief and doesn't specify what the design feature is or how it relates to natural systems. However, it does imply a connection between the design and the environment through recycling, which is a positive environmental impact. The student vaguely touches upon a systems connection by mentioning recycling, which is a process that interacts with human and natural systems. Therefore, the student scores 1 for Systems Connections and 1 for Positive Environmental Impact. The other criteria are not met as there's no clear feature explanation or identification of specific natural systems."

The answer seems incomplete and lacks specific examples or connections to the broader context."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

The student mentions attempting to include elements that help the environment and biophilic design, but fails to provide specific examples or details. The answer does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the natural systems or how they are connected. However, the mention of 'help the environment' indicates some awareness of the positive environmental impact.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

However, it does hint at a positive environmental impact by stating a connection to nature, which is why it scores 1 for Positive Environmental Impact."

However, the answer lacks clarity and specific examples related to the chosen feature and its implementation across Welsh schools.

The answer fails to demonstrate a clear understanding of the environmental impact, community benefits, or future resilience related to their chosen feature.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

For 'Feature Selection & Explanation', the student mentions using solar panels and having an indoor garden, but doesn't explain how these features were chosen or how they work. For 'Systems Identification', the student implicitly refers to the atmosphere (solar energy) and biosphere (indoor garden), but doesn't explicitly state these systems. The 'Systems Connections' score is awarded because, although not explicitly stated, there's an implicit connection between using solar energy and supporting plant growth in the indoor garden. For 'Positive Environmental Impact', the student doesn't directly state how their feature helps the environment, but one can infer that using solar panels and growing plants indoors could reduce carbon footprint and improve air quality."

The feature selected is the use of pipes for water management, which is a relevant aspect. However, the explanation is brief and lacks depth. The student identifies the connection to water management, which relates to the hydrosphere, showing some understanding of systems. The connection between the systems is somewhat explained, as the student mentions using collected rainwater for plants or flushing toilets, indicating a basic understanding of how different systems can be linked. The positive environmental impact is mentioned implicitly through water conservation. Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding but lacks detailed explanations and clear connections between different Earth systems."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The response does not meet the criteria for Feature Selection & Explanation as it doesn't describe a feature or explain how it connects to natural systems. It vaguely mentions 'Energy Systems', which could be related to Systems Identification, but it's too vague to be certain. However, if we consider 'Energy Systems' as an attempt to identify a system, it scores 1 for Systems Identification. For Systems Connections, the answer fails to elaborate on how different systems interact, hence it scores 1 for attempting to mention a system, but not making any connections. Lastly, it doesn't discuss the positive environmental impact, so it scores 0 for Positive Environmental Impact. The total score is 2 out of 5."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

It would benefit Wales as it would encourage the population to eat healthier and would help the environment by causing less food waste to enter landfills and we would not have to take as many resources from earth because we could just reuse them. It would help the local community as the school could also sell any spare vegetables they grow to the locals.

The student correctly identifies that fresher air could lead to healthier kids and reduced energy consumption by minimizing the need for ventilation systems. However, the response lacks depth in discussing future resilience, a crucial aspect of the project's long-term viability. The answer could be strengthened by exploring how this feature might help schools adapt to future challenges or resource shortages."
