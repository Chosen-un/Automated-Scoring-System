For instance, what are the results or outcomes of the forest system when it rains and trees grow?\n### Advice\n* Keep practicing defining terms and explaining examples in a structured way.

The example of a forest is relevant, showing some understanding of natural systems. The student identifies 'water' as an input and touches upon a process ('when it rains, trees grow'), which is a simplified but relevant explanation of some components of the system. However, the explanation is not detailed, and the output component is missing. The answer lacks clarity and a structured approach, making it hard to follow at times."

This demonstrates a good understanding of potential actions (Action Identification: 1). The explanation of their impact was somewhat simplistic, stating that less meat means less water used and bags reduce plastic, which shows a basic understanding but lacks detail on why these actions matter beyond a general statement that they are 'Important for nature' (Explanation of Impact: 0.5). The actions are relevant to Earth's systems as they relate to water usage and plastic reduction, showing an understanding that these actions impact natural systems (Relevance to Systems: 1). However, the answer lacks depth and clarity in explaining why these actions are significant and how they interconnect with Earth's systems, making the response somewhat superficial (Depth and Clarity: 0.5)."

The lower score for 'Depth and Clarity' is due to the need for more precise and detailed explanations."

The response earns points for 'Systems Integration' by mentioning the input (sun), process (making electricity), and output (power for school). It also scores points for 'Boundary Benefits' by noting the reduction in fossil fuels and its help to the climate boundary. 'Interconnections' is scored as the answer connects the energy system to the air system. The 'Changemaker Angle' is recognized as the student mentions being a changemaker by using solar panels. However, the answer lacks a clear description of the feature, proper structure, and use of evidence, hence scoring 0 in 'Feature Description', 'Structure and Organization', and 'Use of Evidence'. 'Depth of Analysis' earns 1 point as it superficially analyzes the system's impact. 'Clarity and Language' scores 0 due to the simplistic and somewhat disjointed language used."

The student correctly identifies inputs, processes, and outputs related to a garden system and mentions the benefits at the boundary, such as land change. The interconnections between plants and animals are also noted, showing an understanding of how different components of a system interact. The student references evidence from the chapter on ecosystems, which aligns with the 'Use of Evidence' criterion. The 'Changemaker Angle' is addressed by suggesting that changemakers can design the garden. However, the 'Clarity and Language' score is 0 because the answer is very concise and lacks detailed explanations, making it somewhat hard to follow. The 'Depth of Analysis' is limited, scoring 1, as the response is more of an outline than a detailed analysis. Overall, the student shows a good grasp of systems thinking but needs to work on elaborating their ideas and improving the clarity of their writing."

The answer scores well on 'Systems Integration' and 'Interconnections' because it connects human activities to natural systems and highlights the relationship between composting and waste reduction. It also scores on 'Use of Evidence' and 'Changemaker Angle' as it uses a natural example to support its point and suggests a sustainable practice. However, it lacks a clear description of a specific school feature, has poor structure and organization, and the language is not clear or concise, which affects its scores on 'Feature Description', 'Structure and Organization', and 'Clarity and Language'. The 'Depth of Analysis' is limited, hence a score of 1. 'Boundary Benefits' is not addressed as the answer doesn't discuss how the system benefits different stakeholders or boundaries."

The answer scores points for Systems Integration, Boundary Benefits, Interconnections, and Changemaker Angle because it attempts to connect natural systems to human-made systems and highlights the benefit of less pollution. However, it lacks a clear description of a specific school feature, has a disorganized structure, and fails to provide concrete evidence or clear language, resulting in low scores for Feature Description, Structure and Organization, Use of Evidence, and Clarity and Language. The Depth of Analysis score is moderate because the answer attempts to relate natural processes to human sustainability efforts."

The student correctly describes the nitrogen cycle as an example of a natural system's circularity and connects it to the concept of a circular economy. The answer effectively integrates systems thinking by explaining how humans can learn from nature's systems to regenerate soil and reduce pollution. However, the answer lacks a clear description of a specific school feature like a garden or energy system, which is why 'Feature Description' and 'Boundary Benefits' are not fully scored. The student provides a relevant example from farming, showing an understanding of interconnections within systems. The structure is logical, and the language is clear. The 'Changemaker Angle' is evident as the student suggests a practical application of systems thinking to improve sustainability. The 'Depth of Analysis' is scored highly because the student effectively analyzes the connection between natural systems and human activities, showing a good understanding of the topic."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The suggestions to 'have shorter showers' and 'use public transport' are relevant to reducing resource consumption and pollution, earning 1 for Suggestion Relevance. However, the explanation of benefits is limited; the student mentions saving water and reducing pollution but doesn't directly link these actions to pushing Overshoot Day later, resulting in a score of 1 for Explanation of Benefits instead of 2 because the connection to Overshoot Day is not explicitly made. The answer lacks depth and clarity, as it is quite simplistic and doesn't fully articulate the ideas, hence scoring 0 for Depth and Clarity."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

This shows a good understanding of the core difference, earning 1 point for Difference Accuracy. The student also highlights a key feature of each economy, 'waste vs no waste,' which is accurate and earns 1 point for Key Features. The example given for a T-shirt in both economies is relevant and illustrates the concept well, thus scoring 2 points for Example Relevance. However, the answer lacks clarity and a structured format, making it hard to follow at times. Therefore, it scores 0 points for Clarity and Structure. The total score is 4 out of 5."

The student correctly identifies that a linear economy involves taking resources, making waste, and causing harm, while a circular economy involves reusing, repairing, and regenerating. This shows accuracy in explaining the difference (Difference Accuracy: 1). The key features of both economies are touched upon, such as waste in linear economies and regeneration in circular economies, so the student scores well on Key Features (Key Features: 1). The use of a T-shirt example to illustrate the difference between linear (landfill) and circular (remade) economies is relevant and effectively supports the explanation, thus scoring full marks on Example Relevance (Example Relevance: 2). However, the answer lacks clarity and a structured format, making it somewhat difficult to follow. The points are disjointed and not well-connected, which affects the overall readability (Clarity and Structure: 0)."

However, the 'Human Application' is not fully developed as the student vaguely mentions learning from 'mature to repair things', which is somewhat related but not clearly connected to circular economy practices, hence 0.5 points. The 'Learning Connection' is somewhat established by mentioning that these natural processes are 'good for the circular economy', scoring 1 point. The 'Depth and Clarity' are lacking as the answer is brief and not fully elaborated, resulting in 0.5 points. Overall, the answer shows a basic understanding but lacks clarity and depth."

However, the discussion on the benefits of shifting to a circular economy is lacking, hence 0 for Benefits Discussion. The answer is somewhat structured and easy to follow, scoring 1 for Structure and Organization. The student fails to provide evidence to support their claims, resulting in 0 for Use of Evidence. The analysis is superficial but does touch on the main issue, scoring 1 for Depth of Analysis. The language used is clear, scoring 1 for Clarity and Language.

Shifting to circular helps by reusing materials in cycles like nature. We can use a biological cycle for organic stuff and a technical one for metals.

They correctly mention the two main cycles in a circular economy: biological and technical. The benefits discussed include job creation, environmental improvement, and reduced pollution. The student's answer is clear and easy to understand, demonstrating a good grasp of the basic concepts. However, the structure and organization could be improved, as the answer feels a bit disjointed. The use of evidence is minimal, with only a simple example of a t-shirt being changed from linear to circular. The depth of analysis is satisfactory for the given context, but the conclusion could be stronger. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but could improve in terms of organization, evidence, and conclusion."

They also understand that shifting to a circular economy can solve these issues by 'closing the loop' and reusing or repairing items, earning 1 for Circular Solutions. The student recognizes the two main cycles in a circular economy - biological and technical - and provides examples, scoring 1 for Cycle Examples. They discuss the benefits of a circular economy, including less waste, which is better for the planet, scoring 1 for Benefits Discussion. However, the answer lacks a clear structure and organization, failing to score for Structure and Organization. There's also a lack of evidence to support the claims made, resulting in a score of 0 for Use of Evidence. The depth of analysis is somewhat limited but still touches on key concepts, scoring 1 for Depth of Analysis. The language is clear, scoring 1 for Clarity and Language. Unfortunately, the conclusion is weak and doesn't effectively summarize the main points or reiterate the significance of the shift to a circular economy, scoring 0 for Conclusion Strength."

If we shift to circular we can use biological cycles (e.g. composting waste like food) and technical cycles (e.g. repairing electronics instead of throwing them away). One other example might be T-shirts, which in linear economy means the cotton grown to make therm is thrown away. If we use a circular way it means the cotton is recycled. Benefits inclulde the environment (less pollution and nature can recover) and social, eg. new jobs. The chapter on doughnut economy shows how we can do this. This means we can prevent overshoot day and it is very important for both humans and the planet.",

If we shift to circular we can use biological cycles (e.g. composting waste like food) and technical cycles (e.g. repairing electronics instead of throwing them away). One other example might be T-shirts, which in linear economy means the cotton grown to make therm is thrown away. If we use a circular way it means the cotton is recycled.

This means we can prevent overshoot day and it is very important for both humans and the planet.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

Relevant examples, like composting and repairing electronics, are provided, justifying a score of 1 for Cycle Examples. The benefits of shifting to a circular economy, including environmental and social advantages, are discussed, warranting a score of 1 for Benefits Discussion. However, the Structure and Organization score is 0.5 because the answer jumps between ideas without a clear logical flow. The Use of Evidence is also 0.5 due to the vague reference to 'the chapter on doughnut economy,' which lacks specific details or citation. The Depth of Analysis is scored 1 as the student touches upon key issues and solutions. The Clarity and Language score is 1 since the answer is generally understandable. Finally, the Conclusion Strength is 1 because the student concludes by highlighting the importance of the shift for both humans and the planet."

The student provides examples of different cycles (biological and technical) using a T-shirt as an example, earning 1 for Cycle Examples. The benefits of a circular economy, including a clean planet and job creation, are mentioned, scoring 1 for Benefits Discussion. The student references 'chapter doughnut,' likely referring to Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics, which shows an attempt to use evidence, scoring 1 for Use of Evidence. The analysis is somewhat thoughtful, comparing linear and circular economies, which scores 1 for Depth of Analysis. However, the answer lacks a clear structure and organization, with points listed disjointedly, resulting in a score of 0 for Structure and Organization. The language is not clear, with several disjointed phrases, scoring 0 for Clarity and Language. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points, scoring 1 for Conclusion Strength."
