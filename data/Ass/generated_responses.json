In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

For 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact', the student mentions that it would be 'more sustainable in the long run' and 'help the environment a lot', which indicates some understanding of environmental benefits, hence a score of 1. However, the answer fails to elaborate on how this would happen or provide specific examples, which is why it doesn't score higher. For 'Community Benefits' and 'Future Resilience', the answer does not provide any relevant information, so both score 0. 'Overall Understanding' also scores 0 because the response is too vague and doesn't demonstrate a clear grasp of the project's aims or the implications of the feature's widespread adoption."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The student mentions including the Biosphere in their work and wanting to encourage more insects, which shows some understanding of Systems Identification. However, the explanation is vague and doesn't clearly link to the Geosphere or other natural systems. The answer hints at a Positive Environmental Impact by making the school a better place, but this is not explicitly connected to natural systems or the design feature.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

The carbon monitor monitored the carbon levels in the room and when it went to high the windows automatically opened which then the classroom was filled with fresh air. This design had many design features as we focused on how we can make the air quality better in the classroom which comes under The Earth's Atmosphere. Our design feature also included building materials for the monitor itself and the windows. Also its biodiversity features which we used as a biophilic design for the windows and a biodegradable plastic for the carbon monitor. In the project we thought a lot about how we can make our design more Eco- friendly which took a lot of consideration and thinking when thinking for designs. Our design will have such a positive impact on the planet. We focused on how we can help the planet and not how we can make it better. This is because we need to help the planet in steps and do little things which have a great outcome. Like how we can make the air quality in the classroom better which allows major health benefits for young people as with fresh air it increases focus,happy moods and a more positive way to look at learning.\n\n        Output your response as a single JSON object wrapped in `<json>` and `</json>` tags.\n        'score_breakdown': A dictionary with scores for each rubric criterion (e.g., '{\"Criterion A\": 2, \"Criterion B\": 1}').\n        'total_score': An integer summing the scores.\n        'rationale': A string with the detailed reasoning and advice for the teacher.\n        'feedback': A structured string with the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and encouraging advice.\n        ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

The student mentions 'using less pollution' which relates to the atmosphere, showing some understanding of Systems Identification. However, the connection to the design feature is not elaborated upon, hence the low score for Feature Selection & Explanation and Systems Connections. The answer hints at a Positive Environmental Impact by reducing pollution, which earns a score for that criterion.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The student vaguely mentions that their 'project feature connects with atmosphere,' which is a part of Systems Identification, hence scoring 1. However, the answer fails to elaborate on the feature itself, how it interacts with the atmosphere, or any positive environmental impact, resulting in low scores across other criteria."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

It would benefit Wales as it would encourage the population to eat healthier and would help the environment by causing less food waste to enter landfills and we would not have to take as many resources from earth because we could just reuse them.

However, it lacks a clear explanation of how this impacts Wales as a whole. The answer does not directly address community benefits, such as how the generated electricity could be used or how it might benefit the local community. The mention of helping schools 'cope with climate challenges' indicates some understanding of future resilience. The overall understanding is limited as the answer is quite brief and doesn't fully explore the implications of adopting the design feature across all schools in Wales."

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

For 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact,' the score of 1 is given because, although the answer is vague, the mention of 'Energy Systems' could be interpreted as a very weak attempt to discuss environmental or systemic change. However, 'Community Benefits,' 'Future Resilience,' and 'Overall Understanding' are all scored 0 because the answer fails to provide any relevant or understandable information related to these criteria."

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The feature is somewhat explained, earning 1 point for 'Feature Selection & Explanation'. However, the student fails to explicitly identify the Earth's natural systems involved, hence scoring 0 for 'Systems Identification'. The answer implies a connection between the hedges and the natural environment, as well as a positive impact on the students' well-being, scoring 1 for 'Systems Connections'. The hedges are also noted to have a positive environmental impact by introducing 'stunning greenery', earning 1 point for 'Positive Environmental Impact'. Overall, the response lacks depth in explaining the connections to Earth's natural systems."

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

The student mentions 'geosphere' and 'eco friendly/sustainable school', indicating some understanding of the systems involved, but fails to elaborate on how these elements interact. The answer scores 0 for 'Feature Selection & Explanation' because it doesn't describe the feature or its connection to natural systems.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

The students could also help and plant the vegetables and knowing that they planted them, it would encourage them to eat the healthy food. We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork.

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy.

The response mentions 'no waste' and 'alot of water for people to drink', indicating some understanding of environmental benefits, but it's vague and doesn't directly relate to the feature or its implementation in schools across Wales. The answer fails to clearly articulate community benefits, future resilience, or a comprehensive understanding of the project's aims.

They mention using solar panels and having an indoor garden, but do not elaborate on how these features interact with natural systems. The answer hints at a connection between their design and the environment, as solar panels and indoor gardens can be seen as environmentally friendly. However, the explanation is not thorough, and the systems involved are not clearly identified or connected. The student does not explicitly state the natural systems they are referring to, but the use of solar panels implies a connection to the energy from the sun, and the indoor garden suggests a connection to the biosphere. The positive environmental impact is also vaguely mentioned, as renewable energy and local food production can reduce carbon footprint. To improve, the student should elaborate on how their design features connect to specific natural systems and explain the positive environmental impact in more detail."

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle.

We would also take the wasted food from school dinners and put it into a com poster to then put it back into the soil to plant more vegetables, continuing the cycle. This is apart, of the Biosphere and Geosphere sphere systems. They work together since we use the soil made from wasted food to plant the vegetables that then later on become soil again.Our feature would help the environment by making less food waste in the school.\n        Rationale for Example: Fantastic linking of the final design to systems.  Really nice to see link of vegetable gardens etc and the wider impact on climate. \n        Awarded Score: 5\n        --- End of Example ---\n\n        Now, grade the following student's answer.\n        1.

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

My group added motion detected lights to save electricity bills too! We wanted the real school to be made out of wood because it is more sustainable than bricks since we can re-grow trees. In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

The student attempts to explain how these systems work together, mentioning that the Biosphere includes living things and their habitats, which are part of the Geosphere. This earns a score of 1 for Systems Connections, although the explanation is not as detailed or clear as it could be. The student also mentions that their feature helps the environment by 'rebuilding the habitats,' which earns a score of 1 for Positive Environmental Impact. However, the student fails to explicitly explain their chosen design feature, which is why they score 0 for Feature Selection & Explanation. Overall, the answer demonstrates some understanding of the natural systems and their connections, but could be improved with more clarity and detail."

In the school there could be more bins around to stop people littering as well. If we added more water fountains then people could drink water to get more healthy. The positive change is that the school is more sustainable and healthy. Overall the project was fun and I think the atmosphere would be better with some of these ideas.",

This solves the problem with bad air, with too much carbon dioxide it may feel less easy to concentrate and harder to breath from time to time, so if this idea was included then it wouldnt be so hard to breath or focus on the pupil's classwork. When i mentioned focus better, it means that the student could potentially get higher grades, this will impact their future gcses AND what type of college they want to get in. ",

It would benefit Wales as it would encourage the population to eat healthier and would help the environment by causing less food waste to enter landfills and we would not have to take as many resources from earth because we could just reuse them. It would help the local community as the school could also sell any spare vegetables they grow to the locals.

This is reflected in the score of 2 for 'Wales-Wide Environmental Impact'. The answer also highlights a community benefit, as fresher air could prevent kids from getting sick, earning a score of 1 for 'Community Benefits'. However, the response lacks a clear connection to 'Future Resilience', as it doesn't explain how the feature would help schools adapt to future challenges or resource shortages, resulting in a score of 0. The student shows a good 'Overall Understanding' of how their feature can improve health and reduce energy needs, warranting a score of 1."
